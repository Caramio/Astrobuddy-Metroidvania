# Astrobuddy-Metroidvania
Metroidvania game


---------------------------GAME INFORMATION---------------------------
"Astrobuddy: Lost in Space" is a 2D metroidvania style game prototype.

The game is not fully finished, it was a training project to get into bigger scale projects that require many different components.

The game includes:

1-) NPC and Boss AI using state machine behaviour.

2-) A save system using JSON files that will record the progress of the player and allow the player to 
continue their game from where they left.

3-) simple implementations of particle systems, 2D lights and animations.

4-) A working inventory system.

5-) An options menu to allow the player to save, pause, change control keybinds and audio settings.

6-) A working combat system.

7-) The game used to contain a second playable character that the user can swap between the main character and the second character,
it was later removed because the game took a different direction.

---------------------------THE MEANING BEHIND CERTAIN SCRIPTS---------------------------

Here, a general explanation to the logic behind the game will be given. This project started as a hobby project to learn how to implement a metroidvania type game,
It is not fully commented and optimized due to it being a learning experience for myself as I worked on the game solo. Commenting each line with maximum detail at this
point would be a bigger commitment rather than explaining certain specific scripts here, so the main scripts will be explained here.
